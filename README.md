**Status**: In Development

Welcome to the **Airbnb Clone Project** - a web app that mirrors the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform.

## Project Goals

- Recreate essential features of Airbnb such as property listings, user profiles, bookings, and reviews.
- Build a scalable and maintainable backend using industry-standard tools and practices.
- Implement a robust API that supports both REST and GraphQL queries.
- Employ asynchronous processing and caching for performance optimization.
- Ensure smooth deployments and code quality with modern DevOps practices.

## Team Roles

- **Project Manager**: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of the project. Ensures deadlines are met, manages the teamâ€™s workflow, coordinates meetings, and acts as the bridge between stakeholders and developers.
- **Backend Developer**: Designs and implements the server-side logic, database interactions, and core application functionality.
- **Frontend Developer**: Handles the user interface and experience (UI/UX), integrating with the APIs provided by the backend.
- **Database Administrator**: Responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the PostgreSQL database schema. Ensures data integrity, performance tuning, and backup management.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Implements and manages CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, and deployment workflows. Ensures that the code moves smoothly from development to production environments.
- **QA Engineer**: Develops and executes test plans to ensure software quality. Responsible for identifying bugs, ensuring functionality aligns with requirements, and maintaining high standards of performance.
- **Systems Architect**: Defines the overall system structure, including technology stack decisions, integration patterns, and scalability strategies. Ensures the system is robust and maintainable.
- **Asynchronous Task Manager**: Manages background tasks using **Celery** and **Redis**. This role ensures smooth handling of non-blocking operations such as sending emails, notifications, and scheduled tasks.

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: Web framework for rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: For building RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable and powerful open-source relational database.
- **GraphQL**: For flexible and efficient data querying.
- **Celery**: Handles asynchronous tasks like sending emails or notifications.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and managing session data.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and production environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Ensures continuous integration and deployment.
